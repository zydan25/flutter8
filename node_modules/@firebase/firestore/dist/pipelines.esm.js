 *
 * The Pipeline class provides a flexible and expressive framework for building complex data
 * transformation and query pipelines for Firestore.
 *
 * A pipeline takes data sources, such as Firestore collections or collection groups, and applies
 * a series of stages that are chained together. Each stage takes the output from the previous stage
 * (or the data source) and produces an output for the next stage (or as the final output of the
 * pipeline).
 *
 * Expressions can be used within each stage to filter and transform data through the stage.
 *
 * NOTE: The chained stages do not prescribe exactly how Firestore will execute the pipeline.
 * Instead, Firestore only guarantees that the result is the same as if the chained stages were
 * executed in order.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const db: Firestore; // Assumes a valid firestore instance.
 *
 * // Example 1: Select specific fields and rename 'rating' to 'bookRating'
 * const results1 = await execute(db.pipeline()
 *     .collection("books")
 *     .select("title", "author", field("rating").as("bookRating")));
 *
 * // Example 2: Filter documents where 'genre' is "Science Fiction" and 'published' is after 1950
 * const results2 = await execute(db.pipeline()
 *     .collection("books")
 *     .where(and(field("genre").equal("Science Fiction"), field("published").greaterThan(1950))));
 *
 * // Example 3: Calculate the average rating of books published after 1980
 * const results3 = await execute(db.pipeline()
 *     .collection("books")
 *     .where(field("published").greaterThan(1980))
 *     .aggregate(average(field("rating")).as("averageRating")));
